Code for the WWVB Clock in Popular Science's April 2010 issue.

It is, at present, less fully developed than it could concievably be.  It 
lacks support for things like time zones, and special, exciting messages
to announce upcoming Leap Seconds.  And that, coders, is where you come in.

Furthermore, the project was concieved as a basis for hacking on WWVB time code
signal reception.  So, get to hacking.
