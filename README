Code for the WWVB Clock in Popular Science's April 2010 issue.

wwvb_clock.pde:  This is the main WWVB clock code.

wwvb_signal_simulator.pde: This simulates the WWVB signal for development 
  and testing and provides a test harness for WWVB receiving clock development.

This project implements a WWVB receiver using an Arduino, a C-Max WWVB receiver
module, and a Maxim DS 1307 Real Time Clock module. 

It is, at present, less fully developed than it could concievably be.  It 
lacks support for things like time zones, and special, exciting messages
to announce upcoming Leap Seconds.  And that, coders, is where you come in.

Furthermore, the project was concieved as a basis for hacking on WWVB time code
signal reception.  So, get to hacking.
